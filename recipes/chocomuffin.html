    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate muffins that truly taste of chocolate and stay fresh for days are a rarity! This recipe delivers, thanks to some tidy tricks including hot milk to bloom the cocoa, and a little coffee to enhance the chocolate flavour (you won’t taste the coffee). Using brown sugar, oil, sour cream and less egg meanwhile is the secret to keeping the crumb ultra-moist and tender!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="Ingredients">250g flour</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">200g granulated sugar</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">40g unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">Half teaspoon salt</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">300g chocolate chips</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">2 eggs</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">180g sour cream</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">120ml vegetable oil</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">120ml whole milk</li>
        <li class="Ingredients">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="Steps">Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick spray or use cupcake liners. This recipe yields about 14 muffins, so prepare a second muffin pan in the same manner or bake in batches and reserve leftover batter at room temperature for when the first batch is done.</li>
        <li class="Steps">Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li class="Steps">Whisk the eggs, sour cream, oil, milk, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and fold together with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon until completely combined. (Batter is quite thick, so I recommend a spatula or spoon over a whisk.) Avoid overmixing. The batter will be thick and sticky.</li>
        <li class="Steps">Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top. Bake for 5 minutes at 425°F then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional 15-16 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 20-21 minutes, give or take. (For mini muffins, bake 13-14 total minutes at 350°F (177°C) the whole time.)</li>
        <li class="Steps">Cool muffins for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack until ready to eat.</li>
        <li class="Steps">Cover leftover muffins and store at room temperature for 5 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week.</li>
